        <p>My coding experience so far has been wonderful, thanks to Chiamaka, Adekemi and my new friend Yosimi. Prior to this time, I actually had zero knowledge on coding but now i think I've reached the level of 5 percent. Our teacher is also really great in carrying everyone along. I think I'll do great here.</p>
